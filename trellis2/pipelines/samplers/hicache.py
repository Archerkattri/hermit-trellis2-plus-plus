"""HiCache: Hermite-polynomial velocity forecasting for TRELLIS.2.

Training-free inference acceleration for the TRELLIS.2 flow-matching
samplers. This is a drop-in replacement for the TaylorSeer Taylor-series
velocity forecast (Fast-TRELLIS ``taylor_utils_ss`` / ``faster_utils_slat``)
that instead forecasts the final CFG-combined velocity at *skipped* sampling
steps with a **scaled (physicist's) Hermite polynomial** basis.

Reference
---------
HiCache: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via Hermite
Polynomial Feature Forecasting (arXiv:2508.16984).

Method (verbatim from the paper)
--------------------------------
Let ``F_t`` be the cached feature/velocity at the most recent compute
("full") step and ``N = N_interval`` the spacing between compute steps.
At a compute step we update backward finite differences::

    Delta^0 F_t = F_t
    Delta^i F_t = (Delta^{i-1} F_t - Delta^{i-1} F_{t-N}) / N

At a skipped step with forward horizon ``k`` (number of steps elapsed since
the last compute step) the velocity is forecast as::

    F_hat_{t-k} = F_t + sum_{i=1}^{m} (Delta^i F_t / i!) * Htilde_i(-k)

where ``Htilde`` is the *dual-scaled* physicist's Hermite polynomial with
contraction factor ``sigma in (0, 1)``::

    Htilde_n(x) = sigma^n * H_n(sigma * x)
    H_0(x) = 1,  H_1(x) = 2x
    H_{n+1}(x) = 2*x*H_n(x) - 2*n*H_{n-1}(x)

TaylorSeer is the special case where the basis ``Htilde_i(-k)`` is replaced
by the monomial ``(-k)^i``. The dual scaling (input scale ``sigma*x`` and
coefficient scale ``sigma^n``) suppresses the exponential growth of the
high-order Hermite terms and keeps the forecast inside the numerically
stable oscillatory regime.

Substrate
---------
The cached object is the FINAL velocity ``pred_v`` (exactly the Fast-TRELLIS
substrate): cache ``pred_v`` at compute steps, forecast/reuse it at skip
steps, then rebuild the Euler update with the sampler's own
``_v_to_xstart_eps``. For the SLaT stages ``pred_v`` is a TRELLIS.2
``SparseTensor`` and only its ``.feats`` are cached/forecast; the coords are
carried through unchanged via ``.replace(feats)``. For the sparse-structure
stage ``pred_v`` is a dense tensor and is cached directly.

This module is pure numerics (CPU-unit-tested in ``__main__``); the sampler
classes in ``flow_euler.py`` own the model calls and the SparseTensor glue.

    "Forecast then Calibrate" (arXiv:2508.16211): a static velocity forecaster
    is accurate locally but accumulates a *systematic* extrapolation bias that
    grows with the forward horizon ``k``. A single predictor-corrector
    (Heun-style) blend in velocity space removes most of that bias **without any
    additional network evaluation**: it only reuses the already-cached anchor
    ``F_t = Delta^0`` (the most recent fully-computed velocity) and the
    first-order rate ``Delta^1`` already held in the derivative cache.

    Corrector (trapezoidal / Heun in velocity space)
    ------------------------------------------------
    The plain forecast uses the slope ``Delta^1`` measured at the anchor
    (an explicit-Euler-like single-ended estimate). A Heun corrector replaces
    that with the *average* of the anchor slope and the slope implied by the
    forecast itself, which is the trapezoidal rule and cancels the leading
    second-order extrapolation error term. With a damping ``weight`` (``lambda``)
    that scales the correction by the horizon, the calibrated velocity is::

        F_cal = forecast + lambda * gain(k) * (F_t - forecast)

    i.e. a horizon-scaled shrinkage of the over-confident extrapolation back
    toward the last reliable signal ``F_t``. ``gain(k) = k / (k + interval)``
    rises from 0 (no correction at the anchor, ``k=0``) toward 1 as the forecast
    horizon outgrows the compute interval, exactly where the static forecast is
    least trustworthy. With ``weight=0`` this is a strict no-op (returns the
    forecast unchanged); with ``weight=1`` and a far horizon it collapses to the
    plain-reuse anchor.
